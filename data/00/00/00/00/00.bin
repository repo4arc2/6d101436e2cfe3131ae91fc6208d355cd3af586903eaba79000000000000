你右边的邻居
your neighbor to the right.

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,440
我的右边  不是你的右边

请原谅我没早点来拜访
Forgive me for not stopping by sooner 

72

欢迎你搬来这里
to welcome you to the block.

73
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,750
我岳母之前来了  所以我走了
My mother-in-law was in town, so I wasn't.

81
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,270
你这样一个单身姑娘
So what's a single gal like you 

82
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,750
怎么会住这么一间大房子呢
doing rattling around this big house?

83
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,450
不  我不是单身
Oh, no, I'm not single.

84
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,040
我没看到戒指啊
Oh, I don't see a ring.

85
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,210
相信我  我结婚了

86

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,480
今天也不是节日吧

不  不是节日

感觉好像我们一直在一起

101
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,000
如果想让拉夫记得我们的纪念日
The only way Ralph would remember our anniversary

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,920
除非有款啤酒叫6月2日
is if there was a beer named June 2nd.

103
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,190
-那你打算做点什么  -什么意思
- So, what do you have planned? - How do you mean?

For your special night.

105
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,660
你这样的年轻姑娘不需要太努力
A young thing like you doesn't have to do much,

106
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,470
但布置一下还是很有趣的
but it's still fun to set the scene.

107
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,630
话说  我之前还读了篇很有品味的杂志文章
Say, I was just reading a crackerjack magazine article

108
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,530
叫《如何对待丈夫能留住丈夫》
called "How To Treat Your Husband To Keep Your Husband,"

109
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,520
告诉你  拉夫需要的是
and let me tell you, what Ralph could really use

110
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,710
《如何伺候妻子能不失去妻子》
is, "How To Goose Your Wife So You Don't Lose Your Wife."

111
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,250
等等  我去拿来  我们开始策划
Hang on. I'll go grab it and we can start planning.

112
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,360
这肯定很好玩
Oh, this is gonna be a gas!

The music isn't bothering you, is it, pal?

118
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,000
你是问干扰我工作吗
In terms of distraction from work,

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,040
还是问歌词的不成话让不让我困扰
or the largely nonsensical nature of the lyrics?

120
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,870
-第一种  -那不  谢谢  诺曼
- The first one. - Ah, no, thank you, Norm.

你能不能告诉我  
Would you be so good as to tell me 

124
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,150
我们究竟在这里做什么
what it is we do here exactly?

125
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,400
我们制造什么东西吗
Do we make something?

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,180
计算表格
Computational forms.

134
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,730
没有人能像你那样处理数据  伙计
And no one can process the data quite like you do, pal.

135
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,450
你就像台行走的电脑
You're like a walking computer.

136
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,740

140
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,320
你生什么气
What's got your feathers all ruffled?

141
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,670
是啊  抱歉  我有点紧张
Yes, I'm sorry, I'm a tad on edge.

142
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,880
今天似乎有什么特别之处
You see, it appears there's something special about today,

今天对旺达  我的妻子很特别

145
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,150
见到你很高兴

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,920
我和太太很期待今晚
Wife and I are looking forward to this evening.

148
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,210
哈特先生  对啊
Mr. Hart. Of course!

149
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,240
跟哈特先生和他的好妻子哈特太太一起吃饭
Dinner with Mr. Hart and his dear lady wife, Mrs. Hart.

150
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,940
我刚刚不都说了吗  你什么毛病  孩子
That's what I said. What's wrong with you, son?

151
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,390
你哪里螺丝松了[脱线]吗
Have you got a screw loose?

152
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,690
没有  先生  螺丝都拧紧着呢  先生
Oh, no, sir. Screws all tightened, sir.

153
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,180
那最好了
Yes, I should hope so.

154
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,010
雇员晚餐对于新雇员来说
Employee dinners are a rite of passage

155
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,540
算是个成人礼
for the new hires. 

156
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,490
琼斯就一败涂地
Jones over there failed miserably.

157
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,020
是吧  琼斯
Isn't that right, Jones?

158
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,760
我妻子以为五道菜就足够了
The wife thought five courses would be sufficient.

159
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,070
还有那可怜巴巴的娱乐项目
And there was that paltry excuse for entertainment.

160
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,710
弦乐四重奏
A string quartet?

161
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,650
然后你还丢人地展现了对垮掉一代的热忱
And then you had that embarrassing display of beatnik enthusiasm.

162
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,440
我穿了件翻领毛衣
I wore a turtleneck.

163
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,380
是啊  祝失业的你好运了  琼斯
Yes. Best of luck out there in the unemployment line, Jones.

164
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,020
我的成功多亏了会看人
You know, I owe my success to being a keen judge of character.

165
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,670
你的柜子里没有骷髅吧[肮脏秘密]  幻视
No skeletons in your closet, eh, Vision?

166
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,520
我没有骨骼  先生
I don't have a skeleton, sir.

167
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,870
太好了  你在本公司的未来就在此一举了
Glad to hear it. Your future in this company depends on it.

168
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,710
你们没有什么歌吗
And you don't have a song?

169
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,770
在婚礼上演奏过的特别的曲子
Nothing special you played at your wedding?

170
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,500
没有什么特别的
No, nothing special.

171
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,650
那我借你些唱片吧
I'll just loan you some records then.

172
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,960
我们说了音乐  装饰  衣服
So, we've got music covered, decor, wardrobe. 

173
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,110
那诱惑技巧呢
What about seduction techniques?

174
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,160
那个我会
Oh, I have those.

175
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,180
当然了
Of course, you do.

176
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,190
就想问问  上面都说了什么
Just out of curiosity, what does it say?

177
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,560
你走进房间时
That you should stumble

178
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,020
该被绊倒  好让他接住你
when you walk into a room so he can catch you.

179
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,280
多浪漫
It's romantic.

180
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,780
还有别的招数吗
Any other tricks?

181
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,740
你可以告诉他单身男子的死亡率
You could point out that the death rate of single men 

182
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,200
是已婚男的两倍
is twice that of married men.

183
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,200
那才叫浪漫呢
Now, that's romantic.

184
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,400
幻视家
Vision residence.

185
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,570
-旺达  亲爱的  -幻视  亲爱的
- Wanda, darling. - Vision, sweetheart.

186
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,720
今晚的事
Listen, about tonight...

187
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,290
别担心  亲爱的  我有数
Don't worry, dear. I have everything under control.

188
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,140
那太好了
Oh, well, that is a relief.

189
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,730
我得承认  我好紧张
I must confess, I'm really rather nervous.

190
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,530
"紧张"  为什么
"Nervous"? Whatever for?

191
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,430
亲爱的  你知道我有时还会张口结舌
Well, you know, darling, I still get a little tongue-tied.

192
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,990
小幻  都这么久了...
Vis, after all this time...

193
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,260
此事事关重大  旺达
There's an awful lot riding on this one, Wanda.

194
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,150
如果今晚不顺利  那可能要完了
If tonight doesn't go just so, I think this could be the end.

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,820
也就一晚嘛  没必要那么夸张
Well, it's just one night. There's no need to get dramatic.

196
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,050
我觉得最好的办法  就是取悦妻子
Look, I think the best course of action is to impress the wife.

197
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,450
我觉得最好的办法  是取悦丈夫
And I think the best course of action is to impress the husband.

198
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,270
太棒了
Well, wonderful!

199
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,060
很高兴我们的意见一致
Glad to know we're both on the same page.

200
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,670
那今晚见了  亲爱的
Until tonight, then, my, darling.

201
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,540
今晚见
Until tonight.

202
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,760
你丈夫是不是厌倦了你烤糊他的吐司
Is your husband tired of you burning his toast?

203
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,120
试试我们新改进的吐司伙伴2000吧
Try our new and improved ToastMate 2000.

204
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,670
这是聪明主妇的首选
It's the go-to for clever housewives.

205
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,790
哇  这台机器真亮眼
Say, this machine has some shine.

206
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,840
可不是
You said it.

207
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,650
调好调谐钮  让你的吐司美味如初
Set the dial and get the taste back into your toast.

208
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,340
上下加热元件能应对一切
Top and bottom heating elements can handle anything

209
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,880
从肉卷  到樱桃派  到露面奶酪三明治
from meatloaf, to cherry pie, to open-faced cheese sandwiches.

210
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,890
斯塔克工业的新吐司伙伴2000
The all new ToastMate 2000 by Stark Industries.

211
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,940
遗忘过去  这是你的未来
Forget the past. This is your future.

212
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,400
我们来了
Here we are!

213
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,060
真有气氛
How very atmospheric!

214
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,210
怎么回事  幻视  烧断了保险丝吗
What's going on here, Vision? You blow a fuse?

215
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,750
请原谅  我去找找我太太
Pardon me while I just go and fetch the lady of the house.

216
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,930
猜猜是谁
Guess who?

217
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,970
旺达
Wanda!

218
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,970
幻视
Vision.

219
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,730
这怎么回事
What is the meaning of this?

220
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,400
怎么...
Well, what is...

221
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,380
是啊  这怎么回事
Yeah, what is the meaning of...

222
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,460
怎么回事
Oh, the meaning of it!

223
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,820
你想问这是怎么回事
You want to know the meaning of it 

224
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,160
是这么回事
and the meaning of it is that 

225
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,840
这是索科威亚传统的待客礼节
this is the traditional Sokovian greeting of hospitality.

226
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,320
-猜猜是谁  -我身后是主人吗
- Guess who? - Is that my host behind me?

227
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,500
是的
It certainly is.

228
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,810
-认识你很高兴  -是啊
- Lovely to make your acquaintance. - Yes!

229
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,800
我忘记告诉你  我妻子是欧洲人
See, I forgot to tell you my wife is from Europe.

230
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,350
真有异域风情
Oh, how exotic!

231
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,730
我们可不跟布尔什维克分子一起吃饭
We don't break bread with Bolsheviks.

232
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,820
得了  亚瑟
Oh, hush, Arthur!

233
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,090
怎么这么没文化
Have you no culture at all?

234
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,800
那裙子
And that dress!

235
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,830
是啊  真是...索科威亚的风格  是的
Yes! It's... It's so... Sokovian, is what it is! Yes!

236
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,110
可以到厨房来一下吗  亲爱的
Can I just see you in the kitchen for a moment, sweetheart?

237
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,300
好的
Oh, yes!

238
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,190
-他们是谁  -你穿的是什么啊
- Who are those people? - What are you wearing?

239
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,180
-他们为什么会来  -你穿的是什么啊
- Why are they here? - What are you wearing?

240
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,490
这不是我们的纪念日吗
Well, it's our anniversary!

241
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,920
我们的什么纪念日
Our anniversary of what?

242
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,580
如果你不知道  我才不告诉你呢
Well, if you don't know, I'm not going to tell you!

243
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,610
外面那人是我老板  哈特先生
That... That man through there is my boss, Mr. Hart!

244
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,340
还有他的妻子  哈特太太
And his dear lady wife, Mrs. Hart!

245
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,570
日历上的心心是个缩写
The heart on the calendar was an abbreviation!

246
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,770
你能以音速移动
You move at the speed of sound

247
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,430
而我能让笔在空中飞
and I can make a pen float through the air.

248
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,100
谁需要缩写了
Who needs to abbreviate?

249
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,820
亲爱的  听着  虽然这很浪漫
Darling, listen, it's all romantic to do 

250
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,090
蜡烛  音乐
the candles, the music,

251
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,990
-还有这件美艳的衣服  -嗯
- that stunning outfit... - Well...

252
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,550
我不想不知好歹  但现在
I don't wanna be unappreciative, but right now...

253
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,980
你老板和妻子在等一顿家常晚宴
Your boss and his wife are expecting a home-cooked meal.

254
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,850
是的
Exactly. 

255
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,130
他们会不会满足于
Any chance they'd settle for 

256
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,740
三人分一颗涂了巧克力的草莓
a single chocolate-covered strawberry split three ways?

257
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,860
我可能有更好的主意了
I might have a better idea.

258
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,330
于是我说  "如果我们把表格
So I said, "If we orient the forms 

259
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,690
横向排  而不是纵向排
horizontally rather than vertically,

260
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,520
我们可以用两倍的纸  要两倍的成本价"
"We can use twice the paper, we can bill twice the cost."

261
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,790
您真是个先锋
You truly are a pioneer!

262
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,660
但表格更大层面上的意义是
But the larger purpose of the forms is...

263
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,780
是为了分析我们的输入和产出
Was to analyze our input and our output.

264
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,490
你还真蠢啊  是吧  幻视
You're awfully dense, aren't you, Vision?

265
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,100
艾格妮丝  你救我命了
Oh, Agnes! You're a life-saver!

266
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,470
作为家庭主妇
What kind of housewife would I be

267
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,240
我怎么可能没法随时拿出
if I didn't have a gourmet meal for four 

268
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,870
一顿四人份的大餐
just lying about the place?

269
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,690
嗯...
Well...

270
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,680
不过拉夫从来也就只想吃烤豆子
Not that Ralph ever wants to eat anything but baked beans

271
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,450
也怪不得他是那副样子呢
which explains a lot about his personal appeal, mind you.

272
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,460
天啊
Oh, my! 

273
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,150
旺达需不需要我去厨房帮忙
Do you think Wanda needs help in the kitchen?

274
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,680
我们连点菠萝块或水果馅饼都没看到
We haven't any tidbits or tartlets out here,

275
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,570
甚至没有猪包毯
nary a pig in a blanket.

276
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,610
不...
No, that...

277
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,670
您太客气了  哈特太太
No, that's so kind of you, Mrs. Hart. 

278
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,970
但我相信她没问题的
But I'm sure she's absolutely fine in there!

279
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,360
谢谢  艾格妮丝  我想接下来我自己就行
Oh, thank you, Agnes. I think I've got it covered from here.

280
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,630
你确定吗  亲爱的
Oh, are you sure, dear? 

281
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,030
手多工作快  嘴多闲话多
Many hands make light work. And many mouths make good gossip.

282
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,370
你好坏啊
You're so naughty!

283
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,300
那我给你预热下烤箱吧  亲爱的
Oh, shall I just pre-heat the oven then, dear?

284

我知道你着急

319
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,080
*咿呀咿呀呦*

320
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,510
我接下来该怎么办
Oh, what was I supposed to do next?

321
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,830
主菜是什么来着
Oh, what was the main course again?

322
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,690
是...牛排...
It was... Steak...

323
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,950
不  牛排
No. Steak...

324
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,550
牛排  戴安娜
Steak... Diane!

325
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,570
什么
Yes?

326
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,540
肯定是我妻子在喊我了
Oh, I think that must be my wife summoning me.

327
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,610
她喊你"戴安娜"吗
She calls you "Diane?"

328
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,610
是的  是她给我起的昵称
Yes, it's her pet name for me.

329
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,830
我就来  弗莱德

330
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,320
失陪一下

331
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,180

Oh, no.

332
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,530
要我怎么帮你
How can I be of assistance?

333
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,530
鸡已经不成鸡样了
Well, the chicken is no longer a chicken 

334
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,910
龙虾也飞出去了
and the lobsters just flew the coop

335
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,860
所以只剩牛排了
so the steak is the last man standing.

336
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,550
这里说  我可以用嫩肉剂缩减准备时间
It says here I can cut down the prep time with a meat tenderizer.

337
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,870
好计划  嫩肉剂在哪
Excellent plan. Where's the tenderizer?

338
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,270
你就是
I'm looking at him. 

339

Okay.

342
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,100
把肉打好  找到龙虾  我就回来
Finish the meat, find the lobsters. I'll be right back.

343
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,430
希望你们饿了
I hope you're hungry.

344
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,290
饿死了差不多
Starved, is more like it.

345
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,730
我脑袋都开始晕了
My head is starting to feel woozy.

346
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,570
你们知道吗
Were either of you aware

347
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,410
已婚男人在以令人担忧的速度杀死单身男人
that married men are killing single men at an alarming rate?

348
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,040
你说什么呢
What are you going on about? 

349
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,850
那里面又怎么回事
And what's going on in there?

350
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,650
那会是谁
Who could that be?

351
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,990
来了
Coming!

352
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,310
我敲后门你没开
Oh, you didn't answer the back door.

353
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,000
给你做倒置水果蛋糕的
For your upside-down cake.

354
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,110
我...
I...

355
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,190
那是谁
Who was that?

356
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,420
-推销员  -电报员
- A salesman! - Telegram!

357
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,620
卖电报的男人
A man selling telegrams.

358
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,740
能想象吗  好消息要更贵
Wouldn't you know it. Good news is more expensive.

359
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,780
我找不到龙虾
I couldn't find the lobsters

360
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,800
肉是要打到嫩还是打成泥
and did you want the meat tender or pulverized?

361
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,490
天啊
Oh, dear.

362
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,500

Did you hear that? My wife's head is spinning.

366
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,580
一般来说  我不喜欢她的头那样
Generally speaking, I don't like her head to do that.

367
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,030
得随机应变了
Time to improvise.

368
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,220
我开始觉得
You know, I'm beginning to think 

369
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,350
你不是做管理的料  幻视
you're not management material, Vision.

370
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,390
我原本对你期望很高

371
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,140
但就今晚看到的情况来说
But from what I've seen here tonight,

372

到处看看吧
I mean, look around.

374
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,590
你家里乱成一团
There's all this chaos going on in your household.

375
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,500
我们要吃什么
Now, when are we gonna eat?

376
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,520
晚餐好了
Dinner is served.

377
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,520
晚饭吃早餐吗

快吃吧  别让菜凉了
Well, please eat before it gets cold.

386
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,560
哈特太太  请坐
Oh, Mrs. Hart, allow me.

387
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,780
你们俩从哪里搬来的
So, where did you two move from?

388

你们为什么会来这里

389
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,300
你们结婚多久了

你们为什么还没要孩子

391
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,790
我想我妻子是想说  我们来自...

424

看看都几点了
Well, would you look at the time?

425
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,010
是啊  我们该走了
Yes. We'd better be going.

426
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,540
你们都没事吧
Are you both all right?

427
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,590
我们真的好愉快
We had such a lovely time.

428

430

你今晚让我很骄傲  孩子

431
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,860
周一一早
First thing Monday morning,

432

晚安
Good night!

438
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,020
我们是不寻常的一对  知道吧
We are an unusual couple, ya know?

439
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,140
这从来都没人质疑
Oh, I don't think that was ever in question.

440
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,150
我是说  我们没有纪念日
Well, what I mean is... We don't have an anniversary.

441
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,640
或是歌曲
Or a song.

442
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,830
甚至是婚戒
Or even wedding rings.

443
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,320
这可以弥补
Well, we could remedy that.

444
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,580
今天就可以做我们的纪念日
Today could be our anniversary.

445
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,500
纪念什么  在第一场晚宴中坚持下来吗
Of what? Surviving our first dinner party?

446
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,790
没错  那我们的歌呢
Precisely. And our song could be?

447
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,120
当然是《絮絮叨叨》
Yakety Yak, naturally.

448
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,960
是啊
Naturally. 

449
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,840
戒指呢
And the rings?

450
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,950
你不能为我们做一对吗
Well, couldn't you make some for us?

451
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,590
我愿意
I do.

452
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,610
你呢
Do you?

453
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,670
是  我愿意
Yes. I do.

454
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,400
他们从此幸福地生活在了一起
And they lived happily ever after.

455
